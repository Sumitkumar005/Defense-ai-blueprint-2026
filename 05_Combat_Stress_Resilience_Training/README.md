# Combat Stress Resilience Training System

## Overview
VR-based gradual exposure system that builds psychological resilience to combat stressors through controlled, progressive simulation.

## Key Features
1. Stress Response Baseline Measurement
2. Graduated Exposure (progressive scenarios)
3. Biofeedback Training
4. Emotional Regulation Practice
5. Personalized Progression (AI-adjusted difficulty)
6. Scenario Library (IED, ambushes, casualties)
7. Performance Under Stress Measurement
8. Debrief & Analysis

## Tech Stack
- **VR**: Unity with SteamVR/Oculus SDK
- **Biometrics**: Arduino-based sensors or commercial HRV monitors
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **ML**: PyTorch for adaptive difficulty
