# Defense-AI-Blueprint-2026

## Defense & Military AI Innovation Blueprint 2026

## 🎯 Mission Statement(this is incomplete)

This repository contains **11 groundbreaking AI solutions** for modern warfare & military operations. These projects address REAL problems that exist in defense operations today - solutions to actual pain points discovered through extensive research of current military challenges, operational gaps, and emerging threats.

**Core Principles:**
- **Mission-Critical**: Solves problems that directly impact operational readiness
- **Soldier-First**: Built for the warfighter, not the boardroom
- **Open Innovation**: Educational and accessible for developers
- **Production-Ready**: Real solutions, not research projects
- **Cross-Domain**: Applicable across all military branches

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is self-contained with its own:
- **Backend API** (FastAPI, Django, or Node.js)
- **Frontend/Mobile App** (React, React Native, or Flutter)
- **ML Models** (with placeholders for training)
- **Database schemas** and migrations
- **Docker configuration**
- **Documentation**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- (Optional) MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j for specific projects

### Installation

Navigate to any project directory and follow its README for specific setup instructions.

Example:
```bash
cd 01_Predictive_PTSD_Early_Warning_System
docker-compose up -d
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```
